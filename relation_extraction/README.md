New: Add PTransE (EMNLP 2015) code!



==RESULT==

We list the result of the code in date set FB15k and WN18.

===== DATA =====

I provide FB15k and WN18  datasets used for the task link prediction with the input format of my code in data.zip.

The original data use in the experiment can download in:

FB15k, WN18 are published by the author of the paper "Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data (2013)." [[Download]](https://everest.hds.utc.fr/doku.php?id=en:smemlj12)

FB13, WN11 are published by the author of the paper "Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base Completion". [[Download]](http://cs.stanford.edu/~danqi/data/nips13-dataset.tar.bz2)

New York Times Corpus:  The data used in relation extraction from text which is publish by the paper " Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text". If you want the data, you should buy from LDC (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19) first.

FB40k [[Download]](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0xrtVa)



Datasets are needed in the folder data/ in the following format

Dataset contains six files:



+ train.txt: training file, format (e1, e2, rel).

+ valid.txt: validation file, same format as train.txt

+ test.txt: test file, same format as train.txt.

+ entity2id.txt: all entities and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ relation2id.txt: all relations and corresponding ids, one per line.



Currently we cannot upload data due to huge size. We will release data with codes together once the paper is published.



===== CODE =====

In the folder TransE/, TransR/, CTransR/:



===== COMPILE =====

Just type make in the folder ./



== TRAINING ==

For training, You need follow the step below:





TransE:

	call the program Train_TransE in folder TransE/
	
TransH:
	call the program Train_TransH in folder TransH/

TransR:

	1:	Train the unif method of TransE as initialization.

	2:  call the program Train_TransR in folder TransR/

CTransR:

	1:	Train the unif method of TransR as initialization.

	2:  run the bash run.sh with relation number in folder cluster/ to cluster the triples in the trainning data.

		i.e.

			bash run.sh 10

	3:  call the program Train_cTransR in folder CTransR/

You can also change the parameters when running Train_TransE, Train_TransR, Train_CTransR.

-size : the embedding size k, d

-rate : learing rate

-method: 0 - unif, 1 - bern



== TESTING ==

For testing, You need follow the step below:


TransR:

	call the program Test_TransR with method as parameter in folder TransR/

CTransR:

	call the program Test_CTransR with method as parameter in folder CTransR/

It will evaluate on test.txt and report mean rank and Hits@10
